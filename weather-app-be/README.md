### <b>Weather App Backend </b><br>

The backend is developed with NodeJS. <br><br>
It draws data from the MongoDB database and if there's no corresponding city there, then it draws data from the live weather api called WeatherApi. <br><br>
The DB is on the cloud and allows public access.<br><br>
Used Jest for testing. Run "npm test" to test. <br><br>
Dockerized and deployed on Heroku on "https://limitless-lake-02513.herokuapp.com/". <br><br>
Try "https://limitless-lake-02513.herokuapp.com/forcasts/paris". <br><br>
Use the command "npm run start" to start. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
