## ICTerra Weather App

* Coded by Gamze YÄ±lan.
* Used React, NodeJS and MongoDB.
* The DB is on the Mongo Cloud, the app is on Heroku on "https://protected-escarpment-62566.herokuapp.com/", the backend is on https://limitless-lake-02513.herokuapp.com/.
* Unit tests written using Jest on both front and back.
* Documentation exists.
* Dockerized bot front and back.
* If the city's weather data exists on the DB, draws from the DB. If not, goes to WeatherAPI api (integrated on the node backend) and draws from there. See: https://www.weatherapi.com/
